# Vogsphere, the Claim Code Generator

![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2020) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rp-magrathea/vogsphere)](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/vogsphere/blob/master/LICENSE) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/rp-magrathea/vogsphere/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/rp-magrathea/vogsphere)

## What is it?

Frequently on forum roleplaying sites, members are asked to copy, modify, and then post codes needed to fill out sitewide claims lists. This process is highly error prone, and asks members who may not be familiar with code to make code modifications. With this tool, members can instead fill out a form, click a button, and be given exactly the claims code they need to post, no changes or code modifications needed.

A [demo version of the generator](https://magrathea.guide/vogsphere/src/vogsphere.html) is available to play with via this repo.

**[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are welcome** if you have ideas for improvements to the tool's quality or usability that you'd like to share.

Found a bug? Got an idea for a new feature? Have a question? Please feel free to submit any and all of these as [issues in this repo](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/vogsphere/issues).

## What's included?

- [`src/vogsphere.html`](src/vogsphere.html) (required) is the form members will interact with
- [`src/vogsphere.js`](src/vogsphere.js) (required) constructs the claim HTML when members submit the form
- [`src/vogsphere.css`](src/vogsphere.css) (optional) provides bare bones styling for the demo version (and can be built upon for actual use)
- And the rest is related to keeping this thing tidy and consistent and not needed for using this tool on any RP site.

## How do I use this for my site?

## This looks kinda familiar...

This tool was originally thought up and created by [Daine](https://daine.dev) for [The Breach](https://breached.jcink.net/), where she was an admin. The version provided here has been completely revamped to modernize and improve on the original, and to generalize and document the tool so it can be more easily used as a resource on other sites.
